          At your first consultation we will analyse your personal constitution
          in a number of different ways, including via a short questionnaire
          before we meet you.

          We use both traditional Ayurvedic diagnostic tools as well as modern
          diagnostic tools during the consultation to diagnose the customerâ€™s
          Doshic imbalance.

          Ayurveda looks at the root cause of the menopause, which is hormonal
          imbalance. Every cell in our bodies has healing potential. Ayurveda
          taps into that healing potential to accelerate the healing process.
