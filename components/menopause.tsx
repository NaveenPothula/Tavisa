          The Menopause is an imbalance experienced by all women from the age of
          around 40 onwards and sometimes earlier. It’s caused by a hormonal
          imbalance that eventually affects the physical and psychological
          aspects of a woman’s body. Most menopausal women experience symptoms
          to varying degrees and can last for several years.
